SideWindow lets you cast your editor contents to other devices, via this extension and a [companion webapp](https://www.sidewindow.xyz).

You can use SideWindow from any device, from anywhere in the world, and even collaborate remotely with multiple devices.

**SideWindow is lightweight, super convenient and quick to set up for lighter use cases.  If you're looking for a more fully-featured remote solution, the VS Code Live Share extension is where you may want to look.**


## Demonstration

To get started, open up the SideWindow panel in the sidebar, and hit 'Share Current File'.

You'll receive a room code. If you miss the notification, the room code is also located in the status bar (bottom left).

Go to **[sidewindow.xyz](https://www.sidewindow.xyz)**, and enter the room code you recieved.

If successful, you'll see your VS Code editor contents load into the browser editor.

You can tweak settings such as language highlighting, editor theme and font preferences.

Edits you make in one editor will be mirrored to the others! Connect from any device, from anywhere in the world.

This will even work with multiple connected browsers.
